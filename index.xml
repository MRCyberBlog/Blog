It showed us the concept of credential reuse and weak passwords, along with the wordpress and SUID exploits/abuses.
Anyways, now onto DC-3.2 aka DC-3!
Dropdown to see DC-3's quick overview DC-3 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing. As with the previous DC releases, this one is designed with beginners in mind, although this time around, there is only one flag, one entry point and no clues at all.</description><dc:creator>Matt Raupfer</dc:creator><category>DC-3 (vulnhub)</category><category>hacking</category><category>DC Series (vulnhub)</category></item><item><title>DC-2 of DC Series(vulnhub)</title><link>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/hacking/ctfs/vulnhub/dc-series/dc-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:modified>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/hacking/ctfs/vulnhub/dc-series/dc-2/</guid><description>With DC-1 out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s move onto DC-2 of the DC Series!
Dropdown to see DC-2's quick overview Much like DC-1, DC-2 is another purposely built vulnerable lab for the purpose of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing. As with the original DC-1, it&amp;rsquo;s designed with beginners in mind.
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.</description><dc:creator>Matt Raupfer</dc:creator><category>DC-2 (vulnhub)</category><category>hacking</category><category>DC Series (vulnhub)</category></item><item><title>DC-1 of DC Series(vulnhub)</title><link>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/hacking/ctfs/vulnhub/dc-series/dc-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:modified>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/hacking/ctfs/vulnhub/dc-series/dc-1/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s root DC-1!

Open this to see the box's overview pulled from the above website. DC-1 is a purposely built vulnerable lab for the purpose of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing. It was designed to be a challenge for beginners, but just how easy it is will depend on your skills and knowledge, and your ability to learn.
To successfully complete this challenge, you will require Linux skills, familiarity with the Linux command line and experience with basic penetration testing tools, such as the tools that can be found on Kali Linux, or Parrot Security OS.</description><dc:creator>Matt Raupfer</dc:creator><category>DC-1 (vulnhub)</category><category>hacking</category><category>DC Series (vulnhub)</category></item><item><title>entry to networking</title><link>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/random/networking/networking-concepts/networking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:28:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:modified>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:28:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/random/networking/networking-concepts/networking/</guid><description>Basic Networking A network is two or more hosts connected together in order to exchange data. There&amp;rsquo;s two network types: WAN (Wide Area Network) - network that connects large geographical areas. LAN (Local Area Network) - network that is confined within a WAN network. These networks use the 7 layers above to exchange data.

This starting point is the / (system root) directory.
This particular hierarchy layout is based on the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard).
FHS - (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) Maintained by the Linux Foundation and last updated on June 3rd, 2015.(as of 12-16-22) FHS provides UNIX-like operating systems with a set of file and directory requirements and guidelines.</description><dc:creator>Matt Raupfer</dc:creator><category>linux filesystem hierarchy</category><category>linux structure</category><category>linux</category></item><item><title>resources</title><link>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/resources/resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 19:15:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:modified>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 19:15:00 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://MRCyberBlog.github.io/blog/resources/resources/</guid><description>Let me explain my notes: The brackets() after each tool will indicate if the tool is: (built-in) = available in Kali&amp;rsquo;s repo.
